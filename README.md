## About Me

Hey there, I'm Sai Shravan, and I'm on a mission to master the art of web development and entrepreneurship. Based in the tranquil town of Chilkur, Telangana, I bring a unique blend of passion, determination, and a thirst for knowledge to the world of programming.

Whether I'm crafting clean and responsive web applications or diving deep into the intricacies of JavaScript, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and a scientific mindset. I'm not just learning to code; I'm cultivating the mindset of an entrepreneur, ready to bring innovative ideas to life.

My ultimate goal in life is simple: to be happy and to be the best friend I can be to myself. I'm on a journey of self-discovery and self-improvement, and I'm excited to share this adventure with fellow developers and learners.

Let's connect, collaborate, and code our way to success. Join me on this exciting journey!

## Currently learning

To have a strong understanding of programming fundamentals from the first principles I'm using The Odin Project curriculum.

> ### Progress

- [x] Foundations
- [x] Intermediate HTML and CSS
- [ ] JavaScript **53%**
- [ ] Advanced HTML and CSS
- [ ] React
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Getting Hired

While revisiting these fundamental concepts, I've experienced significant growth and a boost in confidence. Although I embarked on my programming journey back in 2021, diving deep into this curriculum has provided me with fresh insights and a solid grounding in these core topics. It's remarkable how revisiting the basics has enhanced my skills and understanding, making me even more enthusiastic about my programming adventures.
